# rhombixtechnologies_tasks
This repository contains two Python projects: a Fibonacci Sequence Generator and a Voice Assistant. Each project focuses on different tasks, offering solutions for algorithmic computation and voice-based interaction.

This repository showcases two exciting Python projects that work independently but demonstrate different aspects of programming:

1. **[Fibonacci Sequence Generator](https://github.com/asimkha-art/fibonacci-sequence-generator)**  
   This project generates the Fibonacci sequence, offering an efficient way to compute it using Python. You can use this for learning recursion or exploring algorithms.

2. **[Voice Assistant in Python](https://github.com/asimkha-art/voice-assistant-python)**  
   A voice-based Python assistant that listens to your commands and responds accordingly. This project uses libraries like `speech_recognition` and `pyttsx3` to implement speech recognition and text-to-speech functionalities.
